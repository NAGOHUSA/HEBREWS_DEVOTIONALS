We must be willing to let go of our own strength and control, allowing His Spirit to flow through us. When we resist, our spiritual lives become stale and flavorless. But when we surrender, we experience the rich aroma of God's presence. It begins with a simple act of surrender, like the gentle pour of water over the grounds. As we yield to God, we allow Him to draw out the depths of our being, extracting the impurities and revealing the true essence of our hearts. Just as a perfectly roasted coffee reveals its full flavor, our surrendered lives reveal the true character of Christ.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe surrender our lives to You, Lord, and ask that You draw out the depths of our being, extracting the impurities and revealing Your character in us.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nSurrender your life to God daily, just as a pour-over requires releasing coffee grounds to the brew.",
