Similarly, our faithfulness is refined through the slow and deliberate process of trust in God. Just as the water slowly seeps through the grounds, our prayers and petitions are poured out before the Lord, seeking mercy and guidance. In this quiet morning ritual, I'm drawn to the throne of grace, trusting that His presence and power are available to me, not just in times of need, but in every moment. As the crema forms on my coffee, so too does a deeper understanding of God's character and will form within me, a rich and satisfying brew that sustains me throughout the day.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe come before You, Father, with confidence and humility, seeking Your mercy and guidance as we navigate life's complexities. Help us draw near to Your throne, trusting in Your presence and power to sustain us.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nMay our daily routines become opportunities to draw near to God, seeking His mercies and trusting His faithfulness.",
