The beans must be carefully roasted, then ground to release their full flavor. As the water flows through, the extraction begins, and the crema forms, a result of the perfect balance of heat and pressure. Similarly, as we digest the words of Scripture, we must allow the Spirit to 'roast' our hearts, making us more receptive to the truth. As we 'grind' through life's challenges, we must be open to the Word's guidance, allowing it to 'flow' through us, and transforming us into vessels of wisdom. Just as the perfect pour-over requires patience and attention to detail, so too does our journey as disciples. We must be willing to slow down, focus on the Word, and allow it to shape us into the image of Christ.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe pray for patience and attention to detail as we read and heed Your words, Lord. Help us to be transformed by the truth, that we may become vessels of wisdom and reflect Your glory.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nAs we drink in the wisdom of Scripture, may it transform us into vessels of God's glory.",
