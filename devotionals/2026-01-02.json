In the same way, our faith is not just about a surface-level experience, but a deeper, richer relationship with God. Isaiah 43:6 reminds us that God's presence in our lives is a transformation, making us His children, and in turn, allowing us to call Him our Father. Just as a carefully roasted coffee bean reveals its unique flavor, our faith, rooted in God's presence, gives us a distinct identity in the world. This identity is not about who we were or what we've done, but about who we are in Christ – loved, redeemed, and transformed. Our morning ritual, like a pour-over, can be a reminder of this truth, as we slow down, savor, and seek God's presence in our lives.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe thank you, Lord, for transforming us into your children, and for being our Father. Help us to savor your presence in our lives, and to reveal your love to a world in need.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nSlow down, savor God's presence, and let it transform your faith.",
