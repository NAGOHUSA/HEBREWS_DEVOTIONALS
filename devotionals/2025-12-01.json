Just as this process requires patience and attention to detail, our faith journey demands a willingness to walk in the darkness, trusting that God is at work. We must be willing to be \"roasted\" by trials and \"ground\" by our own failures, allowing the heat of our struggles to refine us into the vessels of His light. As we emerge from the darkness, we are transformed, bearing the sweet aroma of Christ's presence. This process, though uncomfortable, is essential for the extraction of our true character and the development of a rich, full-bodied faith.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe ask that You, Lord, would allow us to endure the darkness, trusting in Your refining work in our lives, and that we might emerge transformed, bearing Your light and presence to a world in need.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nWe must trust in God's refining work to transform us into vessels of His light and presence.",
