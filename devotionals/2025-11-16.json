As we surrender to His will, He begins to extract the full flavor of our faith, revealing the rich depths of His character within us. The roasting process requires patience, trust, and surrender, allowing the beans to reach their full potential. Similarly, our faith grows as we submit to God's refining presence, surrendering our desires and trusting in His goodness. Just as the aroma of freshly roasted coffee fills the air, our lives become a sweet fragrance to God as we abide in Him. As we pour out our hearts to Him, He pours in His presence, filling us with joy, peace, and hope.\n\n## Prayer\n\nWe pray that You would be the roaster of our hearts, extracting the full flavor of our faith and revealing Your character within us. Fill us with joy, peace, and hope, that we may abound in Your presence.\n\n## One-Line Application\n\nAs you brew your morning coffee, surrender your day to God's refining presence, trusting in His goodness to extract the full flavor of your faith.",
